The Forced Displacement Microdata dashboard lists publicly available datasets that have a representative sample of refugees or internally displaced people (IDP); by country, year, theme, data producer among others. I customized the Shiny dashboard based on the [Eviatlas](https://github.com/ESHackathon/eviatlas) package.
